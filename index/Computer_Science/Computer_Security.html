<h2>The Instructors</h2>

<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/" title="Professor Dan Boneh">Professor Dan Boneh</a> heads the applied cryptography group at the Computer Science department at Stanford University. Professor Boneh's research focuses on applications of cryptography to computer security. His work includes cryptosystems with novel properties, web security, security for mobile devices, digital copyright protection, and cryptanalysis. He is the author of over a hundred publications in the field and a recipient of the Packard Award, the Alfred P. Sloan Award, and the RSA award in mathematics. Last year Dr. Boneh received the Ishii award for industry education innovation. Professor Boneh received his Ph.D from Princeton University and joined Stanford in 1997.</li>
<li><a href="http://theory.stanford.edu/people/jcm/" title="Professor John Mitchell">Professor John Mitchell</a> is the Mary and Gordon Crary Family Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Stanford University. His research focuses on web security, network security, privacy, programming language analysis and design, formal methods, and applications of mathematical logic to computer science. He is Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Computer Security and his past awards include a Director's Award from the U.S. Secret Service for his efforts in connection with the Electronic Crimes Task Force. Prof. Mitchell is the Stanford principal investigator for the TRUST NSF Science and Technology Center and Chief Computer Scientist of the SHARPS Center for Healthcare IT Security and Privacy.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~dawnsong/" title="Professor Dawn Song">Professor Dawn Song</a> is Associate Professor of Computer Science at UC Berkeley. Prior to joining UC Berkeley, she was an Assistant Professor at Carnegie Mellon University from 2002 to 2007. Her research interest lies in security and privacy issues in computer systems and networks, including areas ranging from software security, networking security, database security, distributed systems security, to applied cryptography. She is the recipient of various awards including the MacArthur Fellowship, the Guggenheim Fellowship, the NSF CAREER Award, the Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellowship, the MIT Technology Review TR-35 Award, and Best Paper awards.</li>
