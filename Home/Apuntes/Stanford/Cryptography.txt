==== Schedule ====
01/2012

==== Maintainers ====
* Dan Boneh

==== Includes ====
* written homeworks
* programming labs

==== Requires ====
The course is self-contained, however it will be helpful to have a basic understanding of discrete probability theory.

==== Provides ====
* inner workings of cryptographic primitives and how to correctly use them
* how to reason about the security of cryptographic constructions
* how to apply this knowledge to real-world applications
* detailed discussion of how two parties who have a shared secret key can communicate securely when a powerful adversary eavesdrops and tampers with traffic
* examine many deployed protocols and analyze mistakes in existing systems
* discusses public-key techniques that let two or more parties generate a shared secret key
* relevant number theory and discuss public-key encryption, digital signatures, and authentication protocols
* zero-knowledge, distributed protocols such as secure auctions
* number of privacy mechanisms
* the course students will be exposed to many exciting open problems in the field
