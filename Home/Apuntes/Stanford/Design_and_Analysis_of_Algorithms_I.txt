==== Schedule ====
23/01/2012

==== Maintainers ====
* Tim Roughgarden

==== Provides ====
* fundamental principles of algorithm design
	* divide-and-conquer design paradigm
		* fast sorting
		* searching
		* multiplication
	* several blazingly fast primitives for computing on graphs
		* how to compute connectivity information
		* shortest paths
	* how allowing the computer to "flip coins" can lead to elegant and practical algorithms and data structures
	* how do data structures like heaps, hash tables, bloom filters, and balanced search trees actually work, anyway?
	* how come QuickSort runs so fast?
	* what can graph algorithms tell us about the structure of the Web and social networks?
	* did my 3rd-grade teacher explain only a suboptimal algorithm for multiplying two numbers?

==== Requires ====
* programming in at least one programming language (like C, Java, or Python)
* familiarity with proofs, including proofs by induction and by contradiction
* some discrete probability, like how to compute the probability that a poker hand is a full house

==== Bibliography ====
* Kleinberg & Tardos Algorithm Design
* Dasgupta, Papadimitriou & Vazirani Algorithms
* Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest & Stein Introduction to Algorithms
