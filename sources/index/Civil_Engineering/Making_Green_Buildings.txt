{{./pasted_image.jpg}}

===== Homepage =====

http://www.greenbuilding-class.org/

===== Schedule =====

Starts: 01/2012

===== Description =====

This class is for students who are passionate about improving the sustainability of the built environment and want to learn about how to manage project teams to design and build sustainable buildings. Sustainable buildings do more for their users and they are built productively and with environmental and social sensitivity. This can only happen if everybody involved in making and using a building participates when their input is most useful and if the whole process is managed well. Such an integrated and holistic project management approach requires a new mindset and novel methods, which are taught in the class.

===== Require =====

The class is an entry-level course at the university level. Some of the concepts will be more accessible to students with basic knowledge about the design and construction process, engineering economy, and accounting.
