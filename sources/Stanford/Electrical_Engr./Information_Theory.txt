===== Schedule =====
Starts: 03/2012

===== Description =====

Information theory is the science of operations on data such as compression, storage, and communication. It is among the few disciplines fortunate to have a precise date of birth: 1948, with the publication of Claude E. Shannon's paper entitled "A Mathematical Theory of Communication".

Our course will explore the basic concepts of Information theory. It is a prerequisite for research in this area, and highly recommended for students planning to delve into the fields of communications, data compression, and statistical signal processing. The intimate acquaintance that we will gain with measures of information and uncertainty -such as mutual information, entropy, and relative entropy- would be invaluable also for students, researchers, and practitioners in fields ranging from neuroscience to machine learning. Also encouraged to enroll are students of statistics and probability, who will gain an appreciation for the interplay between information theory, combinatorics, probability, and statistics.

===== Instructor =====

[[http://www.stanford.edu/~tsachy/|Tsachy Weissman]] joined the faculty at Stanford University in 2003, where he now holds the STMicroelectronics Chair in the School of Engineering. His research focuses on Information Theory, Statistical Signal Processing, the interplay between them, and their applications. He is inventor of several patents and involved in a number of high-tech companies as member of the technical board. Among his recent awards and honors are an NSF CAREER, a joint Information-Theory/Communication societies best paper award, a Horev fellowship for Leaders in Science and Technology, and a Henry Taub prize for excellence in research. He is on the editorial board of the IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, serving as Associate Editor for Shannon Theory.
